5. Quick Sort (Deterministic and Randomized)

1️⃣ What is Quick Sort?
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions the array around a pivot and recursively sorts the subarrays.

2️⃣ How does Quick Sort work?
It selects a pivot element, rearranges elements smaller than the pivot to its left and larger to its right, then recursively sorts both halves.

3️⃣ What is deterministic Quick Sort?
Deterministic Quick Sort uses a fixed rule for pivot selection (like first or last element), which can lead to worst-case performance for certain inputs.

4️⃣ What is randomized Quick Sort?
It selects a random pivot each time, which reduces the probability of encountering the worst case, leading to average O(n log n) performance.

5️⃣ What are the best, average, and worst-case complexities?
Best and average case: O(n log n).
Worst case (bad pivot every time): O(n²).

6️⃣ What is space complexity of Quick Sort?
Quick Sort is in-place, requiring only O(log n) stack space on average for recursion.

7️⃣ What is a pivot and why is it important?
A pivot divides the array into two parts. Choosing a good pivot ensures balanced partitions and faster sorting.

8️⃣ What is the partitioning method used?
Common methods are Lomuto and Hoare partition schemes; both rearrange elements around the pivot.

9️⃣ Why is Quick Sort faster in practice?
Because it has excellent cache performance and low overhead compared to other O(n log n) sorts like Merge Sort.

🔟 What is the main drawback of Quick Sort?
It is not a stable sort (relative order of equal elements may change) and can degrade to O(n²) without good pivot selection.
