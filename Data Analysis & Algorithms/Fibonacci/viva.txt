1. Fibonacci Series (Recursive and Non-Recursive)

1️⃣ What is the Fibonacci sequence?
It’s a series of numbers where each term is the sum of the two previous ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on.

2️⃣ What is the recursive formula for Fibonacci?
The recurrence relation is F(n) = F(n−1) + F(n−2), with base cases F(0)=0 and F(1)=1.

3️⃣ How does the recursive Fibonacci program work?
It breaks the problem into smaller subproblems by calling itself for F(n−1) and F(n−2) until base conditions are met.

4️⃣ What is the time complexity of the recursive Fibonacci algorithm?
O(2ⁿ), because it repeatedly recalculates overlapping subproblems.

5️⃣ What is the space complexity of the recursive Fibonacci algorithm?
O(n), due to the recursion call stack depth.

6️⃣ How does the non-recursive Fibonacci algorithm work?
It uses a simple loop to add the previous two numbers and generate the next Fibonacci number in O(n) time.

7️⃣ What is the time and space complexity of the iterative version?
Time complexity is O(n), and space complexity is O(1) because it uses only a few variables.

8️⃣ Why is the recursive Fibonacci inefficient?
Because it recalculates the same subproblems many times, leading to exponential time complexity.

9️⃣ How can recursion be optimized in Fibonacci?
By using memoization or dynamic programming to store and reuse previously computed results.

🔟 Which approach is better and why?
The iterative version is generally preferred because it’s faster, uses less memory, and avoids stack overflow.
