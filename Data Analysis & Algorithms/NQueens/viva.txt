4. N-Queens Problem (Backtracking)

1️⃣ What is the n-Queens problem?
It involves placing n queens on an n×n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

2️⃣ What algorithm is used to solve it?
Backtracking — a systematic search technique that tries placements and backtracks when conflicts occur.

3️⃣ What are the constraints for placing a queen?
No two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.

4️⃣ What is the time complexity of n-Queens?
The time complexity is roughly O(n!) because it explores permutations of queen placements.

5️⃣ What data structures are used?
Typically, arrays or lists are used to track column and diagonal positions for quick conflict checks.

6️⃣ How does backtracking help here?
It places queens row by row and abandons (backtracks) partial solutions that violate the constraints.

7️⃣ How do you check if a position is safe?
Check if the same column or either diagonal already contains a queen. If yes, that position is unsafe.

8️⃣ What is the base condition in the algorithm?
If all n queens are successfully placed (row index == n), a valid configuration is found.

9️⃣ Why is backtracking better than brute force here?
Backtracking eliminates impossible configurations early, reducing the number of checks drastically.

🔟 Can there be multiple solutions?
Yes, the n-Queens problem can have multiple valid solutions depending on n. For example, 4-Queens has 2 solutions.
