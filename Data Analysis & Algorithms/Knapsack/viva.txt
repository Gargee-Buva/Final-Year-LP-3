2. Fractional Knapsack Problem (Greedy Method)

1️⃣ What is the knapsack problem?
It’s an optimization problem where you must maximize total value while staying within a weight limit.

2️⃣ What is the difference between 0/1 and fractional knapsack?
In 0/1 knapsack, you must take the entire item or leave it. In fractional knapsack, you can take parts (fractions) of items.

3️⃣ What is the greedy strategy used here?
Sort items by their value-to-weight ratio and pick the highest ratio items first until the knapsack is full.

4️⃣ Why does the greedy method give an optimal solution here?
Because taking the highest value-per-weight item first maximizes the total value without violating constraints.

5️⃣ What is the time complexity of the fractional knapsack algorithm?
O(n log n), due to sorting items by value/weight ratio.

6️⃣ What is the space complexity?
O(1) extra space, aside from the input arrays.

7️⃣ Why doesn’t the greedy approach work for 0/1 knapsack?
Because 0/1 knapsack doesn’t allow splitting items, so greedy may miss the optimal combination.

8️⃣ What happens if two items have the same value/weight ratio?
The order doesn’t matter in that case; either can be taken first since both contribute equally.

9️⃣ What is the objective function of the knapsack problem?
Maximize ∑(value_i × fraction_i) such that ∑(weight_i × fraction_i) ≤ capacity.

🔟 How is the fraction of an item chosen?
If remaining capacity < item’s weight, take (capacity/weight) portion of its value and stop.
