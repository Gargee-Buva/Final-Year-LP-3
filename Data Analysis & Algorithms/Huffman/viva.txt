3. Huffman Encoding (Greedy Strategy)

1️⃣ What is Huffman Encoding?
It’s a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns shorter binary codes to more frequent symbols.

2️⃣ What is the main idea behind Huffman Encoding?
Frequently occurring symbols should get shorter codes to reduce the average total code length.

3️⃣ What data structure is used in Huffman Encoding?
A priority queue (min-heap) is used to repeatedly extract two nodes with the smallest frequencies.

4️⃣ How does the Huffman algorithm work?
It repeatedly combines the two smallest frequency nodes to build a binary tree. Each left/right traversal adds 0 or 1 to a symbol’s code.

5️⃣ Why is it a greedy algorithm?
Because it makes the locally optimal choice (merging two smallest nodes) at each step, leading to a globally optimal result.

6️⃣ What is a prefix code?
A code in which no symbol’s code is a prefix of another. This property ensures that decoding is unambiguous.

7️⃣ What is the time complexity of Huffman coding?
O(n log n), where n is the number of unique symbols, due to heap operations.

8️⃣ What is the space complexity?
O(n), since each character and its code must be stored.

9️⃣ What is the advantage of Huffman encoding?
It minimizes the average number of bits used per character, achieving high compression efficiency.

🔟 How can Huffman encoding be used in real life?
It’s used in file compression algorithms such as ZIP, GZIP, and multimedia formats like JPEG and MP3.
