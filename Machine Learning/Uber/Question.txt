Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed 
drop-off  location.   
Perform following tasks:   
1. Pre-process the dataset.   
2. Identify outliers.   
3. Check the correlation.   
4. Implement linear regression and random forest regression models.  5. 
Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

RMSE = underroot (1/n summation i=1-n (yi-^​yi)^2​)
Lower RMSE = better model performance.
RMSE = 0 → perfect predictions (no error).

The function takes two GPS coordinates and returns the shortest distance between them on Earth in kilometers.
uses haversine formula to do do.

✅ In short:
This code extracts date and time features from the pickup_datetime column 
to help the model learn when the trip occurred

Graph:-
Interpretation:

The line shows how Uber activity changed month-to-month.
You can identify:
Growth trends (increasing trips)
Seasonal variations (spikes or drops)
Pandemic or special event impacts (if data covers that period)

This code summarizes Uber trips per month, calculates averages, and plots a line chart to show how the number of trips changes over months and years — revealing trends in Uber usage over time.

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `sns.heatmap()`                  | Draws grid showing rides by day/hour |
| `xticks_labels`, `yticks_labels` | Adds readable hour & weekday labels  |
| `ax.xaxis.tick_top()`            | Moves labels above the heatmap       |
| `plt.title()`                    | Adds title “WEEKLY UBER RIDES”       |
| `plt.show()`                     | Displays the plot                    |

Centers the tick labels on each cell (+ .5 adjusts alignment).
Replaces default tick numbers with descriptive labels.

| `from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler` | Imports the `StandardScaler` class used for feature scaling.                                |
| `std = StandardScaler()`                           | Creates a scaler object that will perform standardization.                                  |
| `y_std = std.fit_transform(y)`                     | Fits the scaler to `y` (finds its mean and std) and transforms it — centering `y` around 0. |
| `print(y_std)`                                     | Prints the standardized version of the target variable `y`.                                 |
| `x_std = std.fit_transform(X)`                     | Similarly, standardizes the input features `X` — each column gets mean 0, std 1.            |
| `print(x_std)`                                     | Prints the standardized feature matrix.                                                     |

This code standardizes both your features (X) and target (y) so that all values are on a common scale (mean = 0, std = 1) — ensuring the machine learning model treats every variable fairly.

Linear Regression is a statistical method that finds the best straight-line relationship between input variables (like distance, time) and an output variable (like Uber fare), by minimizing prediction error

imports the metrics module from the scikit-learn (sklearn) library.
This module provides a collection of performance evaluation functions for machine learning models.
