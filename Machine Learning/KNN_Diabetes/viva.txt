experiment 9 – Diabetes Prediction using KNN

Question 1: What is the objective of this experiment?
The goal is to predict whether a person has diabetes based on health features like glucose level, BMI, and age using the KNN algorithm.

Question 2: What kind of algorithm is KNN?
KNN is a lazy learning, instance-based algorithm that stores training data and classifies new samples by comparing them with existing data points.

Question 3: How does KNN work?
It computes the distance between the test point and all training points, selects the K closest neighbors, and assigns the class most common among them.

Question 4: Why is scaling important in KNN?
Since KNN uses distance calculations, features with larger values can dominate the results. Scaling brings all features to the same range, ensuring fair distance measurement.

Question 5: What distance metric is used?
Euclidean distance is the most common metric, calculated as the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding features.

Question 6: What is a confusion matrix?
It’s a 2x2 table showing True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives — helping evaluate the model’s accuracy.

Question 7: What is precision?
Precision indicates the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all predicted positives.

Question 8: What is recall?
Recall measures how many actual positive cases were correctly identified by the model.

Question 9: What is the F1-score?
The F1-score combines precision and recall into a single metric, especially useful when dealing with class imbalance.

Question 10: What are the advantages and disadvantages of KNN?
KNN is simple and intuitive, but it’s slow for large datasets and sensitive to noisy or irrelevant features.
