🏦 Experiment 8 – Bank Customer Churn Prediction (Neural Network)

Question 1: What is customer churn?
Customer churn refers to customers leaving a company or stopping a service. Predicting churn helps the company identify at-risk customers and take action to retain them.

Question 2: What is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)?
ANN is a computational model inspired by biological neurons. It consists of input, hidden, and output layers that learn complex patterns through weight adjustments during training.

Question 3: What are features and target variables in this experiment?
The features include customer attributes such as Credit Score, Age, Tenure, and Balance, while the target variable is Exited, indicating whether the customer left (1) or stayed (0).

Question 4: Why is normalization required in neural networks?
Normalization scales feature values to a similar range (like 0–1). This prevents larger values from dominating the learning process and speeds up convergence.

Question 5: What is an epoch?
An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset during model training. Multiple epochs help the model gradually minimize error.

Question 6: What is a hidden layer?
Hidden layers are intermediate layers between input and output layers. They extract features and capture non-linear relationships in the data.

Question 7: What is an activation function?
An activation function introduces non-linearity into the network. Common ones are ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.

Question 8: What optimizer is used in ANN?
The Adam optimizer is often used because it adapts the learning rate during training for faster and more stable convergence.

Question 9: What loss function is used for binary classification?
Binary Cross-Entropy loss measures the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels.

Question 10: What is overfitting in ANN?
Overfitting occurs when the model learns patterns and noise specific to training data and fails to generalize to unseen data. It can be reduced using dropout or regularization.

Question 11: What is the purpose of the confusion matrix here?
It helps to analyze model performance by showing correct and incorrect predictions, helping compute accuracy, precision, and recall.
