Classify the email using the binary classification method. Email Spam detection has  
two states: a) Normal State – Not Spam, b) Abnormal State – Spam. Use K-Nearest  
Neighbors and Support Vector Machine for classification. Analyze their 
performance.  Dataset link: The emails.csv dataset on the Kaggle

df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)
| Parameter       | Meaning                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `axis=0`        | Drop **rows** with missing values (default)              |
| `axis=1`        | Drop **columns** with missing values                     |
| `inplace=True`  | Apply changes directly to `df`                           |
| `inplace=False` | Return a new DataFrame instead of modifying the original |

The command df.dropna(inplace=True) in pandas is used to remove rows (or columns) that contain missing (NaN) values from your DataFrame.


* df.drop(['Email No.'], axis=1, inplace=True)
Purpose:
Removes the column named Email No. from the DataFrame.

axis=1 → means you’re dropping a column (if it were axis=0, it would drop rows).
inplace=True → applies the change directly to the original DataFrame (df), not a copy.

* X = df.drop(['Prediction'], axis=1)

Purpose:
Creates a new variable X that contains all input features (independent variables).
Drops only the Prediction column from df, since that’s the target/output label.
Does not use inplace=True, so it doesn’t modify df — it just creates a copy in X.

* knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=7)
n_neighbors=7 → means the algorithm will look at the 7 nearest data points to decide the class.

Example:

If you want to classify one test email:
The model finds the 7 closest emails from the training data.
If 5 out of those 7 are “spam,” it predicts spam (1).
Otherwise, not spam (0).

* knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
This is the training phase.

Purpose:
It tells the model to learn patterns from the training data:
X_train: input features (word counts, etc.)
y_train: correct labels (spam or not spam)

* A confusion matrix is a table that shows how well your classification model performed — it compares the actual labels (y_test) with the predicted labels (y_pred).
It’s especially useful for binary classification (like Spam = 1, Not Spam = 0).

|               | **Predicted: 0**        | **Predicted: 1**        |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Actual: 0** | **True Negative (TN)**  | **False Positive (FP)** |
| **Actual: 1** | **False Negative (FN)** | **True Positive (TP)**  |


model = SVC(C = 1)
This line creates an SVM (Support Vector Classifier) model object from sklearn.svm.

🧠 What is SVM?

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification (and regression).
It tries to find the best possible boundary (hyperplane) that separates data points of different classes.

In your case:
The model tries to find a boundary that best separates Spam (1) vs. Not Spam (0) emails.
