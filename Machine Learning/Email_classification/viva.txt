📧 Experiment 7 – Email Spam Classification (Binary Classification)

Question 1: What type of problem is this?
This is a binary classification problem, where each email is classified as either Spam (1) or Not Spam (0).

Question 2: What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?
KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class among its nearest K neighbors using a distance metric like Euclidean distance.

Question 3: How do we decide the value of K in KNN?
The value of K is selected using experimentation or cross-validation. Small K values make the model sensitive to noise, while large K values may oversimplify the classification.

Question 4: What is Support Vector Machine (SVM)?
SVM is a classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the dataset with maximum margin.

Question 5: What is a kernel in SVM?
A kernel is a mathematical function that transforms data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. Common kernels include linear, polynomial, and RBF.

Question 6: What is accuracy in classification?
Accuracy measures how many total predictions the model got correct out of all predictions made. It’s the ratio of correctly classified samples to total samples.

Question 7: What is precision?
Precision tells how many predicted positive samples were actually correct. It focuses on the quality of positive predictions.

Question 8: What is recall?
Recall measures how many actual positive samples were correctly identified by the model. It focuses on completeness.

Question 9: What is the F1-score?
The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Question 10: What is a confusion matrix?
A confusion matrix shows the comparison between actual and predicted results in four categories: True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives.

Question 11: How is text converted into numerical features?
Techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) are used to convert text data into numerical feature vectors for model training.
