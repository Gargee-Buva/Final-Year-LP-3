Implement K-Means clustering/ hierarchical clustering on 
sales_data_sample.csv  dataset. Determine the number of clusters using the 
elbow method.

Pandas - Data loading, cleaning, analysis.
numpy - Used for mathematical and numerical operations on arrays.

seaborn - Used for statistical data visualization.It’s built on top of Matplotlib but provides prettier and more advanced charts like heatmaps, boxplots, and pairplots.

matplotlib - Used for basic plotting and visualization — like line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms.

🔹 KMeans

Purpose:
Used for clustering, i.e., grouping similar data points together without labels (unsupervised learning).
It divides the dataset into a predefined number of clusters (say, 3 or 5).
Each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster center (centroid).

🔹from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis — a dimensionality reduction technique.

Purpose:
To reduce the number of features (columns) in your dataset while keeping the most important information.


| Component            | Purpose                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `pd.read_csv()`      | Reads a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame |
| `sep=","`            | Columns are separated by commas          |
| `encoding='Latin-1'` | Handles special characters safely        |
| `df`                 | Stores the loaded dataset                |

👉 df.shape #used to find out the size (dimensions) of your dataset (rows , columns).

👉 df.describe() gives you a quick statistical summary of your dataset — like average, range, and spread — to help you understand your data better before analysis.

👉 df.info() gives a quick summary of your dataset — how many rows, what columns exist, their data types, and whether any data is missing.

👉 df.isnull() → Returns a DataFrame of the same shape as df,
with True where a value is missing and False where it is not.

.sum() → Adds up all the True values column-wise
(since True = 1 and False = 0 in Python).

So together:
df.isnull().sum() = Count of missing values per column.

👉pd.get_dummies() converts categorical values into binary (0/1) columns —
a process called One-Hot Encoding.

👉df = pd.concat([df,productline,Dealsize], axis = 1)
This command adds the new one-hot encoded columns (productline and Dealsize) back into your main DataFrame df.

So now your df will contain both:
The original columns, and
The new dummy (0/1) columns created from categorical data.

👉 distortions = []
Creates an empty list to store the inertia (distortion) values for each KMeans model.
This loop runs KMeans for different numbers of clusters (1–9), measures how well each one fits (using inertia), and stores those values so you can find the best number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

🧩 Graph Shown:

📈 “The Elbow Method showing the optimal k”

🔹 Purpose of the Graph:

The goal of this graph is to find the optimal number of clusters (k) for your dataset when using K-Means clustering.

In K-Means, you must tell the algorithm how many clusters (k) you want to create.
The Elbow Method helps you decide that number visually.

🔹 What’s on the Axes:
Axis	Represents	Meaning
X-axis (k)	Number of clusters	You tested values of k from 1 to 9
Y-axis (Distortion / Inertia)	Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)	Measures how close data points are to their cluster centers

🔹 How to Read the Graph:

Each point on the graph shows the total “distortion” (error) for a specific number of clusters (k).
As you increase k (add more clusters):
The distortion decreases because clusters fit the data better.
But after a certain point, the improvement becomes very small — that’s the “elbow”.

🔹 What the “Elbow” Means:

The “elbow point” (where the curve starts to bend and flatten) indicates the optimal number of clusters.

Adding more clusters after this point gives diminishing returns — it doesn’t improve results much.

✅ In Your Graph:
Looking at your curve:
There’s a sharp drop from k = 1 → 3.
After k = 3, the curve starts to flatten.

👉 This means the optimal number of clusters (k) is likely around 3.

🔹 Purpose of the Graph: 

This scatter plot visually shows how your data points are distributed in 2D space after applying PCA.

Since your original dataset likely had many columns (features), you can’t visualize it easily.
PCA compresses that information into 2 main components — the two directions that capture the most variance (spread) in the data.

🔹 Axes Meaning:
Axis	Meaning
X-axis → PCA1	The first principal component — the direction capturing the maximum variance (most important pattern in data).
Y-axis → PCA2	The second principal component, orthogonal (independent) from the first — it captures the next most significant variation.

Last Graph :-
The K-Means algorithm analyzed your data and grouped similar points into 3 clusters (since you chose k = 3 earlier).

The different colors show which data points belong to which cluster.

The black X marks are the cluster centroids — each cluster’s “center of gravity”.

The distance between clusters shows how distinct they are:

    * If clusters are far apart, they are well separated.
    * If clusters overlap, some data points are similar between groups.

This scatter plot shows how your dataset was divided into 3 groups by the K-Means algorithm. Each color represents a cluster, and the black X marks are the centers of those clusters. PCA was used to reduce the data to 2D for easy visualization of these groups.
